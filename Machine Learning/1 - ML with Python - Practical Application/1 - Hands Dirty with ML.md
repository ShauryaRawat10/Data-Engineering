Machine Learning:
- We provide both Input and Output to algorithm, so that it can learn from the I/O and produce result for new input.
- Learn - The algorithm understands and finds trend in the data in a multidimensional space

Algorithm vs Model
- Algorithm: How to produce new output from Input
- Model: Trained algorithm with parameters and weights


## Machine Learning
- The study of computer algorithms that can improve automatically through experience using data
  - Machine Learning algorithm finds a pattern in the data and builds a representation of that pattern to make a prediction.
  - Job of ML algo is to find that relationship
  - We need a best fitting algo that fits for that relation for that particular scenario

#### Training vs Inference
- Training: Process of creating a ML algorithm
- Inference: Process of using a trained ML algorithm to make a prediction


#### Stages of ML Project
- Collection of data
- Cleansing and transformation
- Feature selection
- Model selection
- Model training
- Performance assessment
- Deployment of the model

#### Regular Programming vs Machine Learning
- For same input, you will get same output in regular programming
- Algorithm become better with good quality data in ML

#### Grouping of ML Agorithm
- Based on Learing Style
  - Supervised:
    - Data that model learn includes the expected solution
    - eg: Group of email with labels - spam, ham
    - eg: Price of the house given the characteristic of house or location
  - Unsupervised
    - Data does not have any label or value assigned, model must find pattern between them, to predict the label that best fits them
    - eg: Customer classification for online store
    - eg: Clustering of people in social network
  - Semi-Supervised
- Based on Algorithm Type
