# Model to Automate Anomaly Detection

#### Overview
- Anomaly Detection Technique
  - STL decomposition
  - Classification and Regression trees
  - Clustering-based anomaly detection
  - Anomaly detection using Autoencoders
- Introduction to problem and dataset
- Exploratory data analysis and data cleaning
- Building a model for anomaly detection

#### STL Decomposition
- STL -Seasonal and Trendy decomposition using LOESS (LOESS is method for calculating non-linear relationship)
- This technique gives ability to split time series into 3 parts
  - Seasonal
  - Trend
  - Residue
