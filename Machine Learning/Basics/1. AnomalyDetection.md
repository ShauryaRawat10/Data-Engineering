## Course Highlights:
- Introduction to Time series data and Anomaly Detection
- Build a model to automate anomaly detection
- Dealing with the detected anomalies

#### What is time series data
- Time Series data is a sequence or collection of data points obtained through repeated measurements over time.
- Eg: Daily Stock price changes, Daily temperature/ weather records, People getting vaccinated each day
- Components of Time Series data:
  - Trend
  - Seasonality
  - Noise

#### Trend
- Long term consistent up or down movement in a series
- Two Types
  - Deterministic - Can find underlying cause
  - Stochastic - random and unexplainable
 
#### Seasonality 
- Variations that occur at a predictable and fixed rate
- Types:
  - Rise in sales of ice cream in summer
  - Increase in revenue of e-commerce websites during holiday season

#### Noise 
- Noise is short term fluctuation which are not predictable
- It is what is left after removing Trend and seasonality. Harder to forecast
- Type:
  - Daily Stock prices

#### Time Series Analysis
- Time-Series analysis is a technique for analyzing time series data and extracting meaningful statistic information and characteristics from it.
- Examples
  - Retail Sales: Analyzing trends, seasonality for yearly, monthly and quarterly total sales and prepare for staff, inventories accordingly
  - Stock market analysis
  - Weather analysis
  - Heathcare
  - Anomaly detection
  - Astronomy

#### Difference between time-series data and cross-sectional data
- Time Series data

| Date   |  Run Distance |
|--------|---------------|
|12/02/2022    | 5.32    |
|13/02/2022    | 6.7     |

- Cross Sectional Data

| Date   |  User   |  Run Distance |
|--------|---------|---------------|
|12/02/2022  | Jake  | 5.32    |
|12/02/2022  | Ariana   | 6.7     |

#### Stationarity and Autocorrelation
- In time-series data it is important that data is stationary and not auto-correlated
