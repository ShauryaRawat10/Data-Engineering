# Anomaly Detection

## Course Highlights:
- Introduction to Time series data and Anomaly Detection
- Build a model to automate anomaly detection
- Dealing with the detected anomalies

#### What is time series data
- Time Series data is a sequence or collection of data points obtained through repeated measurements over time.
- Eg: Daily Stock price changes, Daily temperature/ weather records, People getting vaccinated each day
- Components of Time Series data:
  - Trend
  - Seasonality
  - Noise

#### Trend
- Long term consistent up or down movement in a series
- Two Types
  - Deterministic - Can find underlying cause
  - Stochastic - random and unexplainable
 
#### Seasonality 
- Variations that occur at a predictable and fixed rate
- Types:
  - Rise in sales of ice cream in summer
  - Increase in revenue of e-commerce websites during holiday season

#### Noise 
- Noise is short term fluctuation which are not predictable
- It is what is left after removing Trend and seasonality. Harder to forecast
- Type:
  - Daily Stock prices

#### Time Series Analysis
- Time-Series analysis is a technique for analyzing time series data and extracting meaningful statistic information and characteristics from it.
- Examples
  - Retail Sales: Analyzing trends, seasonality for yearly, monthly and quarterly total sales and prepare for staff, inventories accordingly
  - Stock market analysis
  - Weather analysis
  - Heathcare
  - Anomaly detection
  - Astronomy

#### Difference between time-series data and cross-sectional data
- Time Series data

| Date   |  Run Distance |
|--------|---------------|
|12/02/2022    | 5.32    |
|13/02/2022    | 6.7     |

- Cross Sectional Data

| Date   |  User   |  Run Distance |
|--------|---------|---------------|
|12/02/2022  | Jake  | 5.32    |
|12/02/2022  | Ariana   | 6.7     |

#### Stationarity and Autocorrelation
- In time-series data it is important that data is stationarity and not auto-correlated

What is Stationarity?
- A time-series data is Stationary if its statistical properties do not change over time.
- Non-Stationary data is unpredictable and can not be modeled or forecasted
- Time Series data is Stationary:
  - It has constant mean
  - It has constant variance
  - No Seasonality
  - Constant auto-correlation

<br>

#### How to test stationarity?
- Plotting data and visually checking for trends and seasonal components
- Statistical test
  - Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test
  - Kwaitkowshi-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin (KPSS) test

#### Making time series stationary 
- Stationary through differencing

```
Time Series data: x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 , ..... , Xn

1st differenced: x2-1, x3-2, x4-3, .... , xn - xn-1

Or if still not stationary, do 2nd differenced

Or, log or square root transformation (Suggested transformations only when differencing is not working)

```

#### Auto-Correlation
- Numerical values that indicate how a data series is related to itself over time.
- The time interval between correlated values is called Lag
- Example: Stock price can be correlated to next day, we say lag is 1
- Range: +1 to -1

## Introduction to Anomaly detection
<br>

#### Anomaly
- Anomaly is an observation, data point or a collection of data points that doesn't seem to follow the same pattern as the rest of the dataset

#### Why detect Anomaly?
- Credit Card Fraud detection
- Stock Market Manipulation
- In Flight Safety of passengers
- Event detection systems in sensor data
