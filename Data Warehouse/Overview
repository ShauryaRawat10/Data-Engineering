What is a data warehouse - Business View
  - You are head of ecommerce data infrastructure
  - Business day to day work
    > Customers: should be able to find good and create new orders
    > Inventory: Staff should be able to stock, retrieve and reorder goods
    > Delivery: Staff should be able to pickup and deliver goods
    > HR: should be able to assess performance of staff
    > Marketing: Should be able to attract new customers
    > Management: Should be able to monitor sales growth

  - Questions for you
    > Can I build databases to support these activities?
    > Are all above questions of same nature?

Business Processes:
Operational vs Analytical Business Processes
  - Operational Process:
    > Customers must be able to find products and make orders
    > Inventory staff, add new products and check staff
    > Delivery staff, pick up and deliver Products

  - Analytical Processes:
    > HR check sales performance
    > Marketing see effect of different sales channel
    > Management monitor sales growth
    > Data team understand customer behavior

Can we have same data source for operational and analytical process?
  - Operational Db (MYSQL, POSTGRE SQL, other relational db)
    > Excellent for operations
    > No redundancy
    > fast insert and update
  - Analytical Db 
    > Too slow for analytics (data is spread across different tables to maintain integrity)
    > Too many joins
    > Hard to understand

Solution: Creating 2 processing nodes
   1. OLTP: Online Transactional processing
   2. OLAP: Online Analytical Processing

Data warehouse is a system (including processes, technologies and data representations) that enables us to support analytical processes
