What is Data Warehouse - Technical View
A data warehouse is a copy of transaction data specifically structured for query and analysis

In computing, a data warehouse also known as enterprise data warehouse, is a system used for reporting and data analysis and is considered a core component of business intelligence.
DWs are central repositories of integrated data from one or more disparate sources.

   Data In      ----->     OLTP    ----->   ETL ---->   Dimension Model    ---->  EDW  ----->   Data Out
                        (Postgre, 
                          mysql, 
                    other relational db)


Dimension Model:
  1. Dimension model is designed to:
     > Make it easy for business users to work with data
     > Improve analytical queries performance
  2. Technologies used for storing dimensional models are different than tradional technologies
  3. Business users facing application such as visualization/dashboards needs clear visuals, aka business intelligence (BI) apps

   3NF: The normalization of relational db makes it harder to do joins and work with different tables
     - Lots of extensive joins
     - Hard to explain to business users

   Star schema: Fact-dimension model connected like a star
             Good for OLAP not OLTP


Facts and Dimensions:
   1. Fact tables:
      > Record business events like an order, a phone call, a book review
      > Fact tables columns record events recorded in quantifiable metrics like quantity of an item, duration of a call, book rating
   2. Dimension tables:
      > Record context of the business events eg: who, what, where, why, etc
      > Dimension tables columns contain attributes like the store at which an item is purchased, or the customer who made the call, etc
